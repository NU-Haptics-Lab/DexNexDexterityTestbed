## Purpose
This README is designed to be a starting point for anyone who wants to learn about the DexNex Dexterity Testbed and how it functions.

## Objective
DexNex's objective is to serve as a testbed for dexterous manipulation. New hardware and software can be installed/integrated with the testbed. It's designed to expedite research of novel manipulators, sensors, algorithms, and controls. 

# System Overview
The system is composed of two stations: the Operator and Avatar. Each station is made of three main subsystems: Arms, Hands, and Vision.

## Operator Station
Here a human operator physically connects to the station and begins teleoperation.

## Avatar Station
Here commands are received over-the-wire and are executed by the Avatar.

## Arms
Robotic arms replicate the pose of the operator's palms

## Hands
Robot hands replicate the joints of the operator's fingers

## Vision
Avatar cameras provide stereoscopic vision to a Head-Mounted-Display (HMD), a.k.a. a VR Headset, which the user wears.
